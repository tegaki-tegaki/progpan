# ProgPan 

> **Prog**ramming Language Token **Pan**gram

## What?

Hi! Welcome to an attempt at curating a list of "token pangrams" in every language! (all PR's welcome!).

This list might be useful for testing syntax highlighters, color themes, tokenization things... etc!

The list might be small for now, but if your language isn't here, go ahead and clone this repo _anyways_, then you're halfway to submitting a PR for that language already!

## Token Pangram?

A [Pangram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pangram) in traditional nomenclature is a small sentence that contains every letter in that alphabet! An example in english is: `the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog`!

A Token Pangram is therefore a program that uses every Token / Keyword in its programming language!

## Checklist

### :heavy_check_mark: A ProgPan should:

- include all the languages tokens (this is a constant WIP as languages evolve over time!)
- try to be small & terse (repeating the same tokens aren't necessary)
- be easy to read by humans (A human has to scroll through it with relative ease to "judge" the ProgPan for whatever usecase they might have!)

It's somewhat of a balancing act between trying to cram as many tokens into a small space VS giving ample whitespace / breathing room to code that could in _theory_ occur naturally. We want to ensure it doesn't devolve into a cryptic "code-golfesque code cacophony".

### :x: A ProgPan should not:

- have to make sense (but bonus points if it does!)
- have to work at runtime / be useful
